            I start by gathering requirements and creating wireframes to visualize the layout of the website. I then design the website using 
            HTML and CSS, ensuring that the website is visually appealing and easy to navigate. I use JavaScript to add interactivity to the 
            website, such as animations and form validation. Finally, I test the website on different devices and browsers to ensure that it 
            works correctly. Throughout the development process, I collaborate with clients to ensure that their vision is realized in the final product.
